## After installing all packages you also need to install packages for database, because i have used JSON-Server as emulation of  DB for this project. 
## npm install json-server
## They are located in "DB" directory, you need to start server, in cmd type this command: 
# `npm run serve-json` 
## Then start React project. 
## Thank you for atention.
